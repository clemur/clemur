# Overall design for Clemur
## Background
The Clemur project aims to implement a deep learning platform that is simple but powerful.
As a personal project or just a time killer on Sunday afternoon, 
this project will practice some modern methodologies designing and implementing a DNN project, 
such as reference some other suitable design, use some cutting-edge technologies that used in some other successful projects.

Hope this project will not be a toy, the primary developers will carry out the work in a rigorous way.
